## Getting Started

**Quick Start:**

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

**Run tests:**

```bash
npm test
```

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. The tests will automatically re-run when you make changes to your code.

**Build for production:**

```bash
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. The build is optimized for the best performance - the code is minified and filenames include hashes for efficient caching. Your app will be ready for deployment!

**Lint and format:**

npm run lint:fix
npm run format
```

Automatically fixes linting issues and formats your code according to the project's style guidelines.
